# FastFourierTransform
C code for the Fast Fourier Transform

This repository contains C code which implements the Fast Fourier Transform.  The current example programmed in utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform to approximate the Fourier transform of the sinc function.  The functions in input_output.c calculate the inputs to the Fast Fourier Transform (e.g. the sinc function) and the Fast Fourier Transform is calculated in fft.c.  A plot of the sinc function and its approximate Fourier transform calculated by the code in this repository is displayed in fft.pdf.
